Once you give then names place them at the top level of your program\nUse function hoisting to your advantage to move functions 'below the fold'. Handle every single error in every one of your callbacks. Use a linter like standard (opens new window)to help you with this. Another way is to\ncreate reusable functions and place them in a module to reduce the cognitive load required to understand your code. Splitting your code into small pieces like this also helps you handle errors, write tests, forces you to create a stable and documented public API for your code, and helps with refactoring.")])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
